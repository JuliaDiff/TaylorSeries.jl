# Summary

The purpose of `TaylorSeries.jl` is to provide a framework to exploit
Taylor polynomials in one and more variables
in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org) [@julia]. In
certain cases, it provides a primitive CAS (computer algebra system),
which works numerically and not symbolically.
The package allows to manipulate polynomials of a specified maximum
degree, including power and composition, as well as series expansions
of some elementary functions on polynomials, e.g. `exp`,
where techniques of automatic differentiation are used
[@Tucker:ValidatedNumerics; @HaroEtAl:ParameterizMeth]. Differentiation and
integration are also implemented.

Two basic immutable types are defined, `Taylor1` and `TaylorN`,
which represent the series expansions in one or several variables,
respectively. These are essentially vectors of coefficients,
ordered by increasing degree. In the case of `TaylorN`, the
coefficients are `HomogeneousPolynomials`, which in turn are vectors
of coefficients representing all monomials with a given number of variables
and order (total degree), in some lexicographical order.

Julia's parametrized type system allows the construction of Taylor series whose coefficient type is any subtype of the `Number` abstract type. Use cases include complex numbers,
arbitrary precision `BigFloat`s [@MPFR],
`Interval`s [@IntervalArithmetic.jl], `ArbFloat`s [@ArbFloats.jl],
as well as `Taylor1` and `TaylorN` objects themselves.

`TaylorSeries.jl` is the main component of
[`TaylorIntegration.jl`](https://github.com/PerezHz/TaylorIntegration.jl)
[@TaylorIntegration.jl], whose aim is to perform accurate integration
of ODEs using the Taylor method, including jet transport techniques,
where a small region around an initial condition is integrated.
It is also a key component of
[`TaylorModels.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/TaylorModels.jl)
[@TaylorModels.jl], whose aim is to construct rigorous polynomial
approximations of functions.

# Examples

We present three examples to show the use of `TaylorSeries.jl`. Other
examples, as well as a detailed user guide, can be found in the
[documentation](http://www.juliadiff.org/TaylorSeries.jl/stable).


As a first example we describe how to generate the [Hermite polynomials][@HermitePols_wikipedia]
("physicist's" version) up to a given maximum order. Firstly we directly exploit the recurrence relation satisfied by the polynomials.

```julia
julia> using TaylorSeries

julia> displayBigO(false);

julia> function hermite_polynomials(::Type{T}, nmax::Int) where {T <: Integer}

         x = Taylor1(T, nmax)    # Taylor variable
         H = fill(x, nmax + 1)   # vector of Taylor series to be overwritten

         H[1] = 1   # order 0
         H[2] = 2x  # order 1

         for n in 2:nmax
             # recursion relation for order n:
             H[n+1] = 2x * H[n] - 2(n-1) * H[n-1]
         end

         return H
     end;

julia> hermite_polynomials(n) = hermite_polynomials(Int, n);

julia> H = hermite_polynomials(10);

julia> function hermite_polynomial(n::Int)
    @assert 0 ‚â§ n ‚â§ length(H) "Not enough Hermite polynomials generated"
    return H[n+1];
end

julia> hermite_polynomial(6)  # degree 6
- 120 + 720 t¬≤ - 480 t‚Å¥ + 64 t‚Å∂

```

The example above can be slightly modified to compute, for example, the 100th Hermite polynomial.
In this case, the coefficients will be larger than `2^63-1`, so the modular
behavior under overflow of the standard `Int64` type will not suffice. Rather, the polynomials should
be generated with `hermite_polynomials(BigInt, 100)` to ensure
the use of arbitrary length integers.

As a second example, we describe a numerical way of obtaining the
Hermite polynomials from their generating function: the $n$th Hermite polynomial
corresponds to the $n$th derivative of the function $\exp(2t \, x - t^2)$.

```julia
julia> ùí¢(x,t) = exp(2t * x - t^2); # generating function; ùí¢ is typed as \scrG<TAB>

julia> xn = set_variables("x", numvars=1, order=10);

julia> x = xn[1];

julia> t = Taylor1([zero(x), one(x)], 10); # Taylor1{TaylorN{Float64}}

julia> gf = ùí¢(x, t); # Taylor1 expansion of ùí¢

julia> HH(n::Int) = derivative(n, gf); # n-th derivative of `gf`

julia> HH(6)
- 120.0 + 720.0 x‚ÇÅ¬≤ - 480.0 x‚ÇÅ‚Å¥ + 63.99999999999999 x‚ÇÅ‚Å∂
```

This example shows that the calculations are performed numerically and not
symbolically, using `TaylorSeries.jl` as a polynomial manipulator; this
 is manifested by the fact that the last coefficient of `HH(6)` is not identical to an integer.
